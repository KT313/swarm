user: pls write a poem with many special symbols and quotation marks and stuff
assistant: In a realm where dreams \"take flight\",
A symphony of symbols \"shine so bright\",
Whispers of infinity, dancing in space,
A tapestry of words, woven with grace.

A \"quotation mark\" holds a secret tale,
Within its curves, emotions prevail.
It captures moments, both joy and sorrow,
Like a gentle breeze on a summer morrow.

A \"special symbol\" with enigmatic allure,
An ellipsis, pauses, whispers unsure.
Three little dots, a breath in disguise,
An invitation to read between the lines.

And there, an ampersand, a union so grand,
Connecting souls, like an eternal band.
Binding thoughts, bridging worlds apart,
A symbol of togetherness, a work of art.

A \"double quotation mark\" embraces a phrase,
Enclosing words, like a tender embrace.
It guards stories, both old and new,
With every \"quote\", the past shines through.

A \"dagger\" symbol, piercing the night,
Cuts through darkness, unveils the light.
A sign of strength, a warrior's might,
Carving paths, through shadows they fight.

As I pen this verse, symbols unfold,
A language of their own, stories untold.
They add depth, intrigue, and mystique,
Like secret codes, only the heart can speak.

So let us cherish these symbols divine,
For they paint pictures, beyond the mind.
They dress up words, with flair and grace,
And bring poetry to life, in this sacred space.
